 # Overview
Hello everyone, my purpose for building this project was to learn the syntax of Kotlin and begin my learning of this language. My goal for this project was to create a simple game that would test my Kotlin learning. My software is a simple hangman game with a few words in a list that it randomly pulls from and creates a hangman game from. Overall my purpose for this was to express what I have been learning in Kotlin.

# Future Work

- I would like to first improve the hangman ASCII art. 
- I would like to expand the word bank for the game.
